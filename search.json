    "text": "2.1 Elements and Dynamics of Transcription networks\n\n2.1.1 Cognitive problem of the cell\nCells sense many kinds of signals like internal state, damage, temperature, osmotic pressure, harmful chemicals etc, hence produce appropriate proteins.\n\nTranscription factor\n\nControls the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to mRNA, binding to a specific DNA sequence. They can transit quickly from active to inactive molecular state\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn E.Coli, evolution selected those transcription factors (internal representations) that symbolize state most important for Cell Survival and Growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Elements of Transcription networks\n\n\n\nThe environmental signals activate specific transcription factor proteins. The transcription factors, when active, bind DNA to change the transcription rate of specific target genes, the rate at which mRNA is produced. The mRNA is then translated into protein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGene is a stretch of DNA, that encodes information needed for production of proteins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 How transcription factors affect rate of production of mRNA?\n=&gt; RNAp binds the specific sequence at the promoter, that controls number of mRNA produces per time\n=&gt; Transcription factors bind specific sites of promoter, that change the probability per unit time RNAp binds to promoter to produce mRNA molecule. Thus transcription factors affect rate of transcription of gene\nThere’s a whole transcription network of transcription factors that effect every other of them!\nNodes - Genes\nEdges - regulations of a gene by protein product of other gene\n\nX → Y means that the product of gene X is a transcription factor protein that binds the promoter of gene Y to control the rate at which gene Y is transcribed.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 How signals affect transcription factors\nSignals affect the activity of transcription factors (inactive to active and vice versa)\nThey carry information from environment, that activate the biochemical signal transduction pathway, which chemically modifies a transcription factor which physically changes the transcription factor protein.\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Timescales\nFrom signal to accumulation of protein products have different timescales at each step. So on a slow timescales, the transcription factor activity level can be considered steady state\n\n\n2.1.6 Modularity of transcription network\nGreen Fluroscent Protein (GFP) can be introduced into a bacteria to make it look green. Now, to regulate it for a particular signal like sugar inducible transcription factor, this causes bacteria to express GFP only in presence of sugar\n\n\n2.1.7 Signs on Edges: Activators and Repressors\nA transcription factor be an activator for some genes and a repressor for others.\nDual transcription factors, can act on a given gene as activators under some conditions and repressors under other conditions.\n\n\n2.1.8 Numbers on the Edges: Input function\nHill function describes the real gene input function considering the equilibrium binding of the transcription factor to its site on the promoter,\nHill function for activator:\n\\[\nf(X^*) = \\frac{\\beta X^{*n}}{K^n + X^{*n}}\n\\]\n\\(K\\) - Activation coefficient (concentration of active X needed to significantly activate expression) or threshold for activating target gene.\n\\(\\beta\\) - Maximal Expression level of the promoter\n\\(n\\) - Steepness of input function (Hill’s coefficient) typically, n = [1 to 4]\nPromoter activity is plotted as a function of the concentration of X in its active form (X*)\n\nSince the probability that activator bind with promoter cannot exceed 1, Hill’s function approach a limiting value at higher levels of \\(X^*\\)\nHill’s input function for repressor: decreasing S shaped curve\n\\[\nf(X^*) = \\frac{\\beta}{1 + {(\\frac{X^*}{K})}^n}\n\\]\n\n\n\n2.1.9 Logic Input functions: Simple framework for Network Dynamics\nHill input functions -&gt; for detailed models\nLogic function ( \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\) for Hill’s function ) is a very steep curve, a step function.\nFor activators:\n\\[\nf(X^*) = \\beta  \\theta (X^* &gt; K)\n\\]\n\\(\\theta = 0\\) or 1 according to logic statement in the parenthesis above.\nFor repressors:\n\\[\nf(X^*) = \\beta  \\theta (X^* &lt; K)\n\\]\n\n\n2.1.10 MultiDimensional Input functions Govern genes with Multiple Inputs",
